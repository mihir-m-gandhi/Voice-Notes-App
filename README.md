### Inspiration

* Internet has become an essential part of our life, these days, everyone want faster internet. WiFi technology uses radio waves to provide internet connectivity. It’s one of the most ubiquitous and standardized access point in the world of technology.  

* Wi-Fi signal strength depends on a variety of factors, such as how far you are from the router, whether it’s a 2.4 or 5ghz connection, and even the materials of the walls around you. The closer you are to the router, the better.

* This application can be used to measure the strength of WiFi signals that your device is receiving. A stronger Wi-Fi signal means a more reliable connection. This is what enables you to take full advantage of the internet speeds available to you.
